| Ruth    | Sometime within ten minutes of the theft, I saw the thief get into a car in the bakery parking lot and drive away. If you have security footage from the bakery parking lot, you might want to look for cars that left the parking lot in that time frame.                                                          |
| Eugene  | I don't know the thief's name, but it was someone I recognized. Earlier this morning, before I arrived at Emma's bakery, I was walking by the ATM on Leggett Street and saw the thief there withdrawing some money.                                                                                                 |
| Raymond | As the thief was leaving the bakery, they called someone who talked to them for less than a minute. In the call, I heard the thief say that they were planning to take the earliest flight out of Fiftyville tomorrow. The thief then asked the person on the other end of the phone to purchase the flight ticket. |
+---------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Notes: <10:25am since the theft, the thief drove away => search for cars left the parking lot between 10:15am and 10:25am.
       The thief withdrawing money from the ATM on Leggett Street => search for ATM transctions before 10:15am.
       The theif and the accomplice planned to take the earliest flight out of Fiftyville tomorrow. Flight ticket was purchased shortly after the theft => search for flight ticket orders after 10:15am.
       A phone call (< 1min) is made to the accomplice shortly after 10:15am.
